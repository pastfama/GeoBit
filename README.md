# GeoBit
Concept
 
    Dynamic Life Choices Based on Geography:
        Players start in a random location (like GeoGuessr), and their life events, opportunities, and challenges are influenced by the location's real-world cultural, economic, and environmental factors.
        For example, if you're dropped in Tokyo, the game might include high-tech career options. In contrast, being placed in a rural area might emphasize agriculture or local traditions.
 
    Exploration and Interaction:
        Instead of just guessing the location, players explore their surroundings to make decisions, gather resources, or unlock events (e.g., find a school to attend, a business to work at, or landmarks for inspiration).
 
    Events Influenced by Geography:
        Local laws, climate, and culture affect life events. For example:
            In Nordic countries, you might get free education but pay high taxes.
            In tropical areas, weather disasters might occasionally disrupt your plans.
 
    Points and Progression:
        Points for guessing your starting location could feed into your overall life score, unlocking perks like education grants, business startups, or world travel opportunities.
 
    Travel and Relocation:
        Add the option to move to a new location, with travel challenges tied to figuring out clues about your next destination.
 
    Multiplayer and Rivalries:
        Compete with others to build the most successful or adventurous life starting from random GeoGuessr-like drops.
